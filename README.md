# MovieGrid-from-omdbapi.com-API
Create a grid of 100 favorite movie posters using omdbapi.com API.

This project will hopefully turn into a Wordpress plug-in at some point, but for now it's just a proof of concept. I have a list of my 100 favorite movies, and I want to display them in a grid. Rather than hunting Google for every single individual movie poster, I am using the API from omdbapi.com to search for and download movie posters. Since posters are downloaded, only new movies added to the list will result in an API call. 

*** I have NOT included my API key here publicly, you can request your own by making a small donation at http://www.omdbapi.com. Once you have it - enter it in line 35 of "posters.php". The code will not work until you have an API key***

For styling I am using the responsive grid CSS code found at http://www.responsivegridsystem.com.  I have merged each of the stylesheets into one big stylesheet.
